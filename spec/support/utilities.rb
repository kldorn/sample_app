#Eliminate the need for the full_title test helper 
#in Listing 5.29 by writing tests for the original helper method, 
#as shown in Listing 5.41. 
#(You will have to create both the spec/helpers directory 
#and the application_helper_spec.rb file.) 
#Then include it into the test using the code in Listing 5.42. 
#Verify by running the test suite that the new code is still valid. 
#Note: Listing 5.41 uses regular expressions, 
#which weâ€™ll learn more about in Section 6.2.4. 
#(Thanks to Alex Chaffee for the suggestion 
#and code used in this exercise.)
